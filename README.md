# TargetGame
Simple game demonstrating game format and creation using Blueprints from Unreal Engine 5.1.1



# Overview

IMPORTANT!
This is only the blueprints that I had written using a tutorial from Unreal Sensai. As GitHub only allows up to 100 mb. I thought it would be better to only push what is new and different as it is easy to migrate these into a game that someone else would like to make.


The game is simple. From any level that you want (including some of the tutorial/starter levels that come with unreal engine). You can set up as many targets as you want and wherever you want within your map. Each target is an object and will be determined in the blueprints how many are left to be shot and handle the endscreen when they are all shot down.

I wrote this to give myself an introduction into using Unreal Engine 5.1. I want to learn more about Unreal Engine as this is a very simple project.

# Development Environment

* Unreal Engine 5.1
Unreal Engine has a very intuitive and easy to learn blueprint system that work as OOP and procedural programing.
